# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-09)

**Core value:** Replace the fleet owner's WhatsApp + Excel chaos with an AI that runs their fleet's performance for them, in 20 minutes a day — by proposing actions a human approves with one click, never firing actions on its own in v1.
**Current focus:** Milestone v2-pivot, Phase 3 (Driver File)

## Current Position

Milestone: v2-pivot
Phase: 3 of 12 (Driver File)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan Phase 3
Last activity: 2026-05-09 — Phase 2 (Decisions Surface + Propose-and-Confirm + Design Partner #1) completed and verified. 6 plans, 6 sequential waves, 188/188 backend tests green, 6/6 Phase 2 frontend tests green, 4-column additive migration applied. Owner now lands on `/decisions` after sign-in. Monitor agent + 3 propose tools + tiered cron live. Admin onboarding wizard + billing dashboard + DarbsReadReport shipped.

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░░░] 17% (2 of 12 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Phase 1 plans completed: 5/5 (Phase 1)
- Phase 2 plans completed: 6/6 (Phase 2)
- Total commits across both phases: ~50
- Total execution time: ~7 hours (orchestrator-clock)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 1. Backend Agent Spine + Data Architecture | 5/5 | ✓ Complete | 142/142 tests green; 5 new Prisma models migrated |
| 2. Decisions Surface + Propose-and-Confirm + Design Partner #1 | 6/6 | ✓ Complete | 188/188 backend + 6/6 Phase 2 frontend tests green; 4-column additive migration; admin wizard + billing + DarbsReadReport |
| 3. Driver File | 0 | Ready to plan | 90-day trend backed by PerformanceSnapshot (Phase 1) + agent's plain-English score explanation |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 6 plans: 02-00 → 02-01 → 02-02 → 02-03 → 02-04 → 02-05 (sequential, all GREEN, 1 revision pass on plans before execution)
- Trend: stable — Phases 1+2 closed with zero rework after revision passes

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

22 decisions extracted from PRD_Darb_v2.md tracked in PROJECT.md. Phase 1 implicitly relied on DEC-promote-agent-to-spine. Phase 2 implicitly relied on DEC-propose-and-confirm-v1, DEC-action-is-the-moat, DEC-pricing-target, DEC-trust-graduated-autonomy. All still status=proposed in PROJECT.md; founder week-1 gates remain unsigned but execution has proceeded under "do it" autonomous-mode authorization.

### Pending Todos

- **8-step design-partner-1 manual dry-run:** documented in `.planning/phases/02-decisions-surface-propose-and-confirm-design-partner-1/02-05-SUMMARY.md` — user must promote a User row to `isSuperAdmin=true`, sign in, run `npm run seed:design-partner-fixture -- --tenantId=<dp1>`, walk through `/admin/onboarding` wizard, verify report.
- **Frontend Sierra-palette test cleanup:** 16 pre-existing frontend tests reference legacy `bg-gray-100` palette; implementation moved to Sierra (`bg-sand-200`) before Phase 2. Not a Phase 2 regression. Worth a Phase 11 cleanup pass.
- **Phase 11 deferred-items.md:** 184 pre-existing tenant-scope violations across 35 legacy non-agent files (DI-01-01).
- **Phase 11 deferred-items.md:** Pre-existing migration-history defect that forced both Phase 1 + Phase 2 hand-crafted migrations (DI-01-02). Resolve by rebuilding shadow DB cleanly during Phase 11.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **WARNING (ingest)**: Arabic outbound timing — Q1 vs Q2. Roadmap default places REQ-bilingual-courier-comms in Phase 9 (Q2); founder-gated. Phase 2 didn't need to resolve this (English-first per current roadmap).
- **Founder-gated**: Design partner #1 still needs to be named. Onboarding wizard is built; 8-step manual dry-run is ready.
- **Founder-gated**: Engineer allocation 1 + Claude Code; Phase 2 took ~5 hours of agent runtime (vs Phase 1's ~3 hours). Phase 3 should be smaller (single page + integration).
