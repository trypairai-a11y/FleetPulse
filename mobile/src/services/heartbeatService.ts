/**
 * Heartbeat service — periodic device telemetry post.
 *
 * Replaces the legacy `dashboard.tsx` 15-min loop that hardcoded `batteryLevel: 1.0` and
 * `appVersion: "1.0.0"`. The Device model on the backend already has a `batteryLevel`
 * column; populating it correctly lets the AI agent flag battery-DoS scenarios where a
 * misbehaving courier app is draining the phone faster than expected.
 *
 * Heartbeat is best-effort: a 4xx/5xx from the backend is logged-and-swallowed. Unlike
 * GPS points, heartbeat carries no business-critical state — the next ping in 15 minutes
 * will overwrite anything we missed.
 *
 * Fields:
 *   - batteryLevel   — 0.0..1.0 from expo-battery (NOT the hardcoded 1.0 the legacy code used)
 *   - appVersion     — semantic version from expo-application nativeApplicationVersion
 *   - isLowPowerMode — iOS low-power mode flag; influences battery telemetry interpretation
 *   - platformGuess  — tier-3 hint, identical to the one attached to GPS uploads
