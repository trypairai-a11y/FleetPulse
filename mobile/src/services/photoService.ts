/**
 * photoService — delivery-photo capture, compress, upload pipeline.
 *
 * Three-step flow:
 *   1. Compress the captured URI down to ~200 KB using expo-image-manipulator
 *      (resize width <= 1280, JPEG, quality 0.7 — keeps detail intact for proof-of-delivery
 *      verification while staying under courier-data-plan caps).
 *   2. POST /api/agent/upload-url to get a presigned PUT URL + an opaque storage key.
 *   3. fetch(presignedUrl, {method:'PUT', headers:{Content-Type:'image/jpeg'}, body:blob}).
 *   4. POST /api/agent/delivery-photo with metadata (key, lat/lng, capturedAt).
 *
 * Why direct-to-storage instead of multipart-through-Express?
 *   A 200 KB JPEG round-tripped through Express costs us 200 KB of egress on Vercel,
 *   plus 200 KB of memory in the Node process. Direct PUT to Cloudflare R2 has zero
 *   egress cost (free) and zero Node memory. The presign step is the only thing the
 *   backend has to mediate — and it's tiny (a signed string).
